indexOf
*/

let arr = [1,2,3,4];
console.log(arr.indexOf(3));
console.log(arr.indexOf(5));

/*
Dry Run:
First call: arr.indexOf(3)

The method searches for 3 in the array.
It finds 3 at index 2.
Output: 2
Second call: arr.indexOf(5)

The method searches for 5 in the array.
It doesn't find 5, so it returns -1.
Output: -1
